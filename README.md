This plugin integrates Atlassian Confluence to Mattermost.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

#### Other Useful Commands
  * `atlas-version`
  * `atlas-clean` or `atlas-mvn clean`
  * `atlas-mvn compile`
  * `atlas-mvn package`
  * `atlas-mvn checkstyle:check`
  * `atlas-mvn idea:idea`

Note: Full documentation is always available in the [Docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK).
